# Project Handoff

## Current Goal

Develop and real-world validate the grandMA3 2.3.2.0 Recipe Tracking Inspector writer. It now supports updating either the tracking source Recipe or the current Cue, with every operation available as one Oops.

## Current Working State

Version `0.4.1.0` reorganizes the UI and separates three explicit write modes: `UPDATE ORIGINAL`, `UPDATE CURRENT CUE`, and `UPDATE NEW CONTENT`.

The button is enabled only when the current selection/Attribute resolves to exactly one Recipe, the programmer supplies exactly one Preset reference, and the new Preset differs from the Recipe's current Values. Clicking UPDATE resolves the context again, shows target/old/new confirmation, explicitly assigns the Preset to the Sequence/Cue/Part/Recipe `Values` property, removes only the contributing Programmer attributes, and verifies `recipe.Values` afterward. All commands share one `CreateUndo`/`CloseUndo` transaction. Unsupported or ambiguous states do not write.

## Latest Real-World User Test

Version `0.2.4.3` passed: compact mode displays the actual Source Cue and opens without the prior clipping. The user approved beginning Update work and required every Update to support Oops (Undo).

`UPDATE ORIGINAL` changes the resolved tracking-source Recipe. `UPDATE CURRENT CUE` is enabled only when the resolved Recipe already belongs to the current Cue. `UPDATE NEW CONTENT` always creates the next free Recipe line in the current Cue and same Part, then assigns the resolved Group and new Preset. The three write buttons have their own row; SELECT GROUP/DETAIL/STYLE/STOP are on a separate utility row, allowing the default width to shrink from 700 to 540 px. Every write mode retains targeted Programmer cleanup and one-Oops behavior. Real grandMA3 testing is pending.

The XML and both referenced Lua components were deployed locally, and all three source/deployment SHA-256 hashes matched.

## Verified Facts

- Persistent non-modal UI, native title dragging, resize behavior, compact/detail, styles, tracking resolution, All preset/Phaser inspection, and SELECT GROUP have passed prior real-world tests.
- Installed grandMA3 2.3.2 system tests use `Assign <Preset:ToAddr()> At <Recipe:ToAddr()>` to replace Recipe Values and verify the operation with Undo (`shared/resource/lib_plugins/systemtests/db/system_test_prog_cook.lua`).
- The official Lua API supports grouping `Cmd` operations into one Oops entry with `CreateUndo` and `CloseUndo`.
- Raw programmer values or a raw Phaser without one unambiguous Preset reference are deliberately not writable in this first version.
- Deployment destination: `C:\ProgramData\MALightingTechnology\gma3_library\datapools\plugins\Update Plugin`.

## Current Problem

The new writer needs a controlled real-world test on grandMA3 2.3.2.0. Confirm that UPDATE changes only the displayed Recipe Values reference, the cooked output follows it, and one Oops restores the prior Recipe Values.

## Known Failed Attempts

- Direct Lua property assignment such as `recipe.Values = preset` is not used for production writes because it has not been shown to join an Undo transaction.
- Do not permit updates when tracking is unresolved/ambiguous or when the programmer has no unique Preset reference.

## Current Branch / Commit

Branch: `qwen`. Version `0.4.1.0` is committed and pushed as part of the mandatory delivery workflow; check `git log -1 --oneline` for the authoritative commit ID.

## Exact Next Action

Import/run v0.4.1.0. Verify the compact two-row button layout, then test all three modes. Confirm `UPDATE CURRENT CUE` is disabled when the source is earlier and `UPDATE NEW CONTENT` creates a Recipe in the current Cue. Verify one-Oops restoration for each mode.
